<!-- FILL IN BIO HERE -->

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student from Distributed Digital Music Archives & Libraries Lab. My primary research topic is automatic harmonic analysis, and I am generally interested in applied machine learning, music information retrieval, music theory, and digital music libraries.

Graduating from Jilin University as a computer science B.S., I achieved M.S. from Peking University, where I was fortunate to engage in the research of music techology, an interdisciplinary field between music and computer science. During my master study, I discovered my passion for research and determined to pursue a doctoral study.
