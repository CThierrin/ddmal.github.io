A recent PhD from New York University, Finn Upham brings together expertese in music cognition, music theory, and mathematics. They joined DDMAL in 2019 as a postdoc for the SIMSSA project, working with Prof. Julie Cumming on features of complexity in liturgical music in the 15th C. 

At NYU, Finn worked on statistics for continuous responses and respiration to music, supervised by Mary Farbood in music technology research at the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development. Their previous studies at McGill involved research on continuous audience responses to music with Stephen McAdams in the Music Perception and Cognition Lab and with Tony Humphries on differential delay equations in Nonlinear Dynamics.

Out of the lab, Finn produces The So Strangely Podcast on Recent Research in Music Science. Finn is nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns.
