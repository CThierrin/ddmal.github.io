<!-- FILL IN BIO HERE -->

100% SWE, 100% SRE.

I'm a Linux systems engineer with a side interest in signal processing for audio and music. My current research topic is exploring the time-frequency uncertainty principle in music demixing, which I am writing my master's thesis on; see the code [here](https://github.com/sevagh/xumx-sliCQ).
