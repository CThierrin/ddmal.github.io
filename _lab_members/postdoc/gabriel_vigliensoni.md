I have been professionally involved in music production, performance, and sound recording for several record labels and artists of diverse musical genres. The experience and the new music economy landscape created a desire to better understand the changing ways in which music is now created, distributed, and enjoyed. This desire led me to pursue a PhD in Music Technology. My main research interests are music composition, production, and sound engineering; music recommendation and listening behaviour; and new interfaces for musical expression, production, and synthesis.
