Lucas completed his undergraduate degree in computer science with a focus on Biomedical Computation and a minor in Music at Queens University. His previous research at the Medical-Informatics laboratory covers machine learning and computational approaches on iKnife aided intraoperative basal cell carcinoma videos for workflow recognition as a surgical aid in relocating positive margins. Lucas is currently pursuing an MA in Music Technology at McGill University. Outside of academics, Lucas is a clarinetist and pianist, collects plants, and is an amateur chess player.
