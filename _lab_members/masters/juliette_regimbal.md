Juliette is a research assistant at DDMAL and recently completed a Bachelor of Engineering.
She mainly works on [Neon](https://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/software/neon/), a browser-based square-notation editor.
She is interested in technology that makes accessing and manipulating information more user-friendly, and how "user friendliness" makes many assumptions about who a user is.

Juliette has an ongoing, one-sided feud with JavaScript and other loosely typed languages.
