<!-- FILL IN BIO HERE -->

Drumming and programming has been his passions since Alex was very little, and it is this passion that drove him to constantly work at developing his skills as an artist, and, as a programmer. "Affecting people with performance or instruction is what makes all of the hard work and dedication worth it" he says. A natural evolution occurred when he combined his too passions of music and technology. He is currently researching  music engraving software and optical music recognition software in order to optimize the generation of symbolic representations of music for large scale database generation.

In his spare time Alex participates in Capture the Flag computer competitions competitions and continues to teach drumset performance.
