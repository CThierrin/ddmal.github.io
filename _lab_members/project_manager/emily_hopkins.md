Emily Hopkins (she/her) has worked as the project manager for the SIMSSA Project (Single Interface for Music Score Searching and Analysis, simssa.ca) since 2015. She is also a member of Library Freedom Project (libraryfreedom.org). She graduated with her MLIS from the University of Alberta in 2020, and before that studied musicology (McGill) and oboe performance (UBC). She is a fan of free and open source software and its many applications, from research data management to reviving old computers to fighting for civil liberties. She lives in Montreal where she can also be found crafting and mending, rollerskating and cycling, practising handstands, and playing the autoharp.
