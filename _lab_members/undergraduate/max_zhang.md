Max Zhang studies Music Performance and Computer Science at McGill University. Through the intersection of both disciplines, he hopes to contribute to the growing landscape of music and technology.

From Vancouver, Zhang performs regularly at music venues across Montreal on trumpet and acoustic bass. He has shared the stage with the likes of Kevin Dean, Ira Coleman, Caity Gyorgy, Jacob Wutzke, and more. Most recently, Zhang has been nominated for the prestigious Hnatyshyn Foundation Oscar Peterson Grant for Jazz Performance by the Schulich School of Music.

Entering his fifth year of undergraduate studies, Zhang is pursuing a double major in Computer Science alongside his Bachelor of Music. He has taken a keen interest in software development, having just completed courses in Software Architecture, Programming Languages and Paradigms, and Applied Machine Learning at McGill, to list a few.

Besides coding and music, Zhang enjoys rock in his off-hours!
