SALAMI is an innovative and ambitious computational musicology project. To date, musical analysis has been conducted by individuals and on a small scale. Our computational approach, combined with the huge volume of data now available from such source as the Internet Archive, will: a) deliver a very substantive corpus of musical analyses in a common framework for use by music scholars, students and beyond; and, b) establish a methodology and tooling which will enable others to add to this in the future and to broaden the application of the techniques we establish. A resource of SALAMI's magnitude empowers musicologists to approach their work in a new and different way, starting with the data, and to ask research questions that have not been possible before.

There are two resources available on this site:

* [Annotation data]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/SALAMI/annotation): Visit this page to access the annotation data and to learn about how it was collected.
* [Blog](http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/blog/author:jordan): Here you'll find updates about SALAMI features and tools. The older posts recount the data collection process.
* [Background]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/SALAMI/background): The background page gives an overview of the SALAMI project. It consists mainly of the proposal for the [Digging Into Data](http://www.diggingintodata.org/) grant that SALAMI was [awarded in 2009](http://diggingintodata.org/awards/2009/project/structural-analysis-large-amounts-music-information).  

Through a Digging Into Data grant, this research was supported by the [Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada](http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/), by the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/), and by [JISC](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/).
